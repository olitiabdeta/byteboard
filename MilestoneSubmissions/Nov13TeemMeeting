Team Meeting Log - November 13th 
    - Post Lab 11 Week

Went through local server functions that currently are working.
Discussed how to fix our GET and POST methods currently. Thinking trouble follows with the .json and making our local host public. 
Once resolved - working on what's next - being the home page and profile page as a priority
